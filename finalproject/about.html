    <h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>
    Holy Chapel  is a church whose primary mission is to introduce sinners to Jesus Christ through evangelism, to equip those who already know Him to know Him better and to serve Christ and His church effectively through discipleship, and to praise, honor, and glorify the living God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
    We are committed to understanding the evolving needs of the people, to providing excellent biblically based programs, to introducing Jesus Christ to the community, and to doing all things in an excellent manner, maximizing our resources to accomplish the greater good. More specifically, the mission is accomplished, and the purpose realized through the work of dedicated, devoted, and disciplined ministers, evangelists, and laypersons who work toward the advancement of the kingdom of God. Every teaching ministry is based on the saving work and Lordship of Jesus Christ, the centrality of His person, and the inerrancy of the Word of God. From this Life Source flows our evangelical perspective, our discipleship equipment, our ministry motivation, and our reason for being.
