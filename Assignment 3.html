    <h3>Travelling in Depression</h3> <!--This is a h3 heading-->
    <p>When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought
        me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has
        given me a unique learning experience.</p>
    
    <p>At five, I <a href="#">Marveled</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the city of Lights. when I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas.
    At thirteen, I saw the aciennt, megalithic structure of stonehenge and <a href="art277.html">
        <img src="girl.jpeg" style="width: auto; height: 200px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px;" alt="girl"></a>walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the
        thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in <br> <a href="https://www.starzit.com">Starz University</a></p>
    <p>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first
        became interested in language.</p>
    
    <p>It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more accent on
        the A, she looked at me bewildered.</p>
    
    <p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
        aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
        Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
        different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to
        me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <a href="mailto:jkortu7062@gmail.com">Send Us Email</a></p>

    <p>Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my
        school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning
        fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means
        volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.</p>
